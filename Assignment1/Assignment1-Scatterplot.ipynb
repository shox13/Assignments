    "# Exploring and Visualizing Data: Scatter Plots\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore a set of New York City train data. We will then use Python to create a **scatter plot** to visualize that data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is used for data with two independent variables. For example, you could use a scatter plot to show the height (x-axis) and weight (y-axis) of individuals:\n",

    "A scatter plot shows how the two variables are correlated. To continue with the example above, the scatter plot shows  that, in general, weight increases as height increases. The correlation isnâ€™t perfect; some taller people weight less than some shorter people.\n",

    "1. Create a demo scatter plot using random data.\n",
    "2. Create a scatter plot that uses train pickup location data.\n",
    "3. Zoom in on the scatter plot to examine the data more closely.\n",
