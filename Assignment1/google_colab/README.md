## Instructions:

- open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- click 'GitHub' tab
- enter the URL to the jupyter notebook:
    - [Assignment1-Heatmap.ipynb](https://github.com/geofflangenderfer/Assignments/blob/master/Assignment1/google_colab/Assignment1-Heatmap.ipynb)
- select google_colab/Assignment1-Heatmap.ipynb from dropdown menu
- run the first cell, which starts with '!pip install -U -q PyDrive' 
- follow the steps for authentication
- run the following cell that contains "df.describe()" to confirm that summary 
  statistics are printed as output (observations, mean, std. dev., etc.). This 
  confirms that we successfully loaded the troublesome train.csv file from 
  Google Drive.
