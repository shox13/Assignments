    "- Nodesize is proportional to how many people use aspecific tag\n",
    "- Tags are grouped together based on similarity. Each group is calculated with a cluster walktrap.\n",
    "- Value is the correlation between the pair * 100. \n",
    "- The greater the value, the closer the pair will be in the graph.\n",

    "The goal of the demo is to create a network graph of this data showing the strength of connections between nodes,\n",
    "how nodes are grouped together, and the size of each node. We have all the data necessary to accomplish this."
