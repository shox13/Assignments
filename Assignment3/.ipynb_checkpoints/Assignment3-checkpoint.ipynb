    "The agent used the model, using the actual value if she had it and the mean value otherwise, and the model returned the estimate you see above. This price will best balance selling her client's home in a timely manner and not leaving any money on the table.\n",

    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "When the agent trains her model on this Boston housing dataset, the model is learning the characteristics of that data. Overfitting occurs when the model reflects the characteristics of the training data too well. In an extreme example, a model whose line passes through every available data point would be needlessly complex, and would not be able to accurately represent a home that is not part of the dataset. For example, if the dataset is made up of condominiums, the model won't do well predicting the price for a single-family home. \n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of overfitting is **underfitting**. Underfitting creates a model that is too simple and does not reflect the characteristics of the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can use **regularization** to increase her confidence that her model isn't overfitting and that she can use it on a variety of homes. Regularization tends to push the value of the learned parameters lower, sometimes to zero, by deciding whether a feature (such as CRIM, RM, and others) is actually a good predictor. The result is a less complex model less prone to overfitting. \n",
